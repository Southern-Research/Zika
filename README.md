Southern Research is committed to sharing our expertise in animal model development and our internal R&D data with the Zika community. The current release includes basic descriptions and summary graphs/tables for the Cynomolgus Macaque and AG129 Mouse models as well as raw data for the Rhesus Macaque data. You can find an overview of our Zika virus program on our [website](http://www.southernresearch.org/zika-virus/). Our goal is to update this repository to include a full description, summary graphics, and raw data for each model as expiditiously as possible.
